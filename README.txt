== Welcome To CritRoller! ==

This program will help you randomly roll Crits and Fumbles.

= How To Use =

1. Initial Setup
- Before you start to use the program for the first time you have to
create a database. To do this just go to the Menu and choose
'Create Database'. Make sure you enter a valid file name! (No % , " etc.)
- Next, you have to add Crits and Fumbles. For now, you can only add them
individually through Menu->Add Crit/Fumble...
- Make sure to select the correct database file and weapon type.
- Keep in mind that the 'Text' field is mandatory

2. Rolling Crits
- To get a random Crit/Fumble first select a database
- Select an attack type (e.g. slashing, bludgeoning etc.)
- What is the 'used' tag? Every time you roll a crit or fumble it will be
flagged as 'used'. This function prevents you to roll the same thing over
and over again. If you've rolled all unused crits you can reset the database
from Menu->Reset 'used' tags.
- However, if you want to use all entries from the database
you can tick the box and all of them will be included and no 'used' tag will
be added to the crit. When you do this, make sure you have the correct
database selected!

= Warning =
Keep in mind that all database actions are irreversible.
For now no entries can be removed from the database with this program
and reset 'used' tags cannot be undone.

Now go and roll those 20's and 1's!
